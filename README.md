# Conference Minutes Generator
This project is an AI-powered web application that automatically generates structured meeting minutes from long audio recordings.
It combines speech-to-text processing using Whisper with multi-stage summarization powered by large language models, while handling long inputs through audio segmentation and token-aware chunking.
The system is designed for practical use cases such as committee meetings, study sessions, and internal discussions.
